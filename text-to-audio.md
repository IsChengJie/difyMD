            For text messages generated by Dify, simply pass the generated
            message-id directly. The backend will use the message-id to look up
            the corresponding content and synthesize the voice information
            directly. If both message_id and text are provided simultaneously,
            the message_id is given priority.

          description: >-
            Speech generated content. Used if message_id is not provided or not
            found.

        At least one of `message_id` or `text` must be provided, along with

      description: >-
        API Key authentication. For all API requests, include your API Key in
        the `Authorization` HTTP Header, prefixed with 'Bearer '. Example:
        `Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}`. **Strongly recommend storing your API
        Key on the server-side, not shared or stored on the client-side, to
        avoid possible API-Key leakage that can lead to serious consequences.**
